1. Deployment Preparation:
  
  i)Use and Check Environment Variables
  
  ii)Polish and test code.
  
  iii) ng build --prod  uses ahead of time completion
  
  iv) deploy these build artifacts to a static host. Static host is only capable of handling html,css,javascript.not backend like node/java
  
2. Use Environment variables.

  i) We have two files in src->environments environment.ts and environment.prod.ts
  
  ii) environment.ts is used during devlopment and environment.prod.ts is used during production.
  
  iii) both these files are swapped automatically.
  
  iv) Add environment variables in files only import environment.ts and copy all the key:values also in environment.prod.ts and during prod
  
      these files will be automatically swapped.
  
3. Firebase Hosting

ng install -g firebase-tools

firebase init hosting use existing project
