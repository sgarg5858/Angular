1. How Authentication Works?

a) We can't use sessions because RestFul a nd GraphQL API's both are stateless.ThereFore Client and Server aredecoupled from each other.

b) Session would be stored on the server and server doesnot care about client.Thus Session is no solution.

c) Instead we will use different approach where server will validate the user email and password and if all that data is valid.the server will

send client a token, a JSON Web Token Typically.That is an encoded string which contains a lot of meta data, which means string could be

unpacked and can be read by client.

d) Moreover, the token is generated on server with certain algorithm and a certain secret which only the server knows and only the server 

can validate incoming tokens for their validity. because the idea is that client(our Angular app) will store the token is some storage

(local storage of browser) and attaches the token to any request that there after is sent to the server which needs to be authenticated.

e) Say user want to post a new post after successfull logging in.Then we have send the token in header or as query parameter.

f)Server is able to validate the token because server created the token with certain alogrithm and a private key.which is only known 

to server.that is how token is secured. We cant change or edit the token on the client because as soon as we do that, I t will not fit the

algorithm and private key used on the server, there for server is able to detect th token is invalid or not if invalid then it will block 

the access.

We will use Jwt Authentication?

Token consists of three parts header.payload.signature.

1)Header  has 2 parts type of token and hashing algorithm used.The JSON structure comprising these two keys are Base64Encoded.

2)Payload contains the claims.Primarily, there are three types of claims: 

3)Signature ensures that the token is not changed on the way.
