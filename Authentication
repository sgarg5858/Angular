1. How Authentication Works?

a) We can't use sessions because RestFul a nd GraphQL API's both are stateless.ThereFore Client and Server aredecoupled from each other.

b) Session would be stored on the server and server doesnot care about client.Thus Session is no solution.

c) Instead we will use different approach where server will validate the user email and password and if all that data is valid.the server will

send client a token, a JSON Web Token Typically.That is an encoded string which contains a lot of meta data, which means string could be

unpacked and can be read by client.

d) Moreover, the token is generated on server with certain algorithm and a certain secret which only the server knows and only the server 

can validate incoming tokens for their validity. because the idea is that client(our Angular app) will store the token is some storage

(local storage of browser) and attaches the token to any request that there after is sent to the server which needs to be authenticated
