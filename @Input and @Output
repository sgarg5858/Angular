we know how property binding works like we can provide the value to html element from typescript file.

app.html

<img [src]="path">

app.ts

path="your path to img"

This is property binding. Now we want to transfer data from parent to child component if we look closely above we are doing the same 
say app is parent and img is child and we are passing path to [src].

app.html

 <app-server-element 
      *ngFor="let serverElement of serverElements"
      [element]="serverElement"
      ></app-server-element>
      
 server-element.html
 
 @Input() element;
 
 Now lets understand above , Instead of img we have our component here we have to bind to custom property of this component.
 By default component properties are not bindable or accessible outside component .For that we have @Input() decorator.It makes the property bindable from outside.
 Think of it like we are getting an input from parent.
